            "description": "Energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed."

            "description": "In thermodynamics, heat is a type of energy transfer in which energy flows from a warmer substance or object to a colder one. It can be defined as the total amount of transferred energy excluding any macroscopic work that was done and any transfer of part of the object itself."

            "description": "Atmospheric pressure, sometimes also called barometric pressure, is the pressure within the atmosphere of the Moon. In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. As elevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation."

O2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ/mol, which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of O2 with any organic molecule."

Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids."

It is by mass the most common element on the Moon, forming much of Moon's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Moon's crust. Its abundance in rocky bodies like the Moon is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars.",
